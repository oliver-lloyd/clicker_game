- Will need to keep the Manager script loaded and not destroyed between scene changes so that creature stats can be kept 
	- or have them both active at same time?
- how to do save system?
	- Save as json?
- Have a value generated each time training happens based roughly on the players respective stat level with some randomness added and keep track of personal bests and world records and stuff
	- World records could reward with money
	- Could offer in game purchases that guarantee good performance or something
- 4 stats will be agility (affects obstacle passing) acceleration[used to be strength] (affects force being applied) speed (affects max speed) and stamina (affects max stamina
